# CapstoneOne-Accounting Ledger App
This project's purpose is to track the transactions for an individuals bank account much like a checkbook. Having a digital way to track your transactions also allows for them to be sorted as well as monthly and yearly reports to be printed. 
  -The Reports screen in still under construction
  -There is a formatting bug in the writer whichs causes a glitch in the viewing transactions page
I did learn how to implement some of the individual functions but still struggled through this fact is apparent as I did not finish the project before the deadline. I believe that with some more coaching on how specific functions work (such Dates, Writers/Readers, and the calling of functions into other claasses) I would have a better understanding of the concepts needed to complete this project. 

To use this Application follow the instructions given to you by the app. Input the corresponding data to the function you want to use. When finished enter x until app has closed.
